            Basal melting of Antarctic ice shelves is primarily driven by heat delivery from warm Circumpolar Deep Water. Here we classify near-shelf water masses in an eddy-resolving numerical model of the Southern Ocean to develop a unified view of warm water intrusion onto the Antarctic continental shelf. We identify four regimes on seasonal timescales. In regime 1 (East Antarctica), heat intrusions are driven by easterly winds via Ekman dynamics. In regime 2 (West Antarctica), intrusion is primarily determined by the strength of a shelf-break undercurrent. In regime 3, the warm water cycle on the shelf is in antiphase with dense shelf water production (Adélie Coast). Finally, in regime 4 (Weddell and Ross seas), shelf-ward warm water inflow occurs along the western edge of canyons during periods of dense shelf water outflow. Our results advocate for a reformulation of the traditional annual-mean regime classification of the Antarctic continental shelf.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The formation and downwelling of cold Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and the concurrent upwelling of warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) around the Antarctic margin are key processes in the global climate system, driving the renewal of cold dense water to the deep ocean, while transporting heat, nutrients, and carbon upwards and poleward towards Antarctic ice shelves. Observational and modelling studies have documented that AABW has warmed, freshened, and contracted in recent decades. However, the response of CDW to anthropogenic forcing is less clear, with some model-based studies projecting a poleward migration of its southern boundary. In this study, we utilise the physical and chemical seawater properties measured from relatively sparse ship-based observations to robustly classify Southern Ocean water masses. We then train a random forest machine learning model to accurately apply the water mass classification to the abundant Argo temperature and salinity data spanning the Southern Ocean over the past two decades, allowing for local assessment of variability on monthly-to-decadal timescales. Our analysis reveals an increase (decrease) in CDW thickness near (away from) the continent, indicating a poleward migration of CDW upwelling. This trend is accompanied by a contraction in AABW layer thickness along the Antarctic margin. This spatial redistribution suggests an enhanced heat flux toward the Antarctic continental shelf, with potential implications for basal ice shelf melting and sea-level projections.},

	abstract = {Identification of water masses in the Atlantic Ocean is key to
	understanding large-scale circulation, transport, and mixing processes.
	However, traditional classification methods, such as Optimum
	Multi-Parameter analysis (OMP), are often limited by relatively sparse
	hydrographic profiles. Here, we develop a hybrid framework, which uses a
	random forest (RF) modelling approach trained upon an initial OMP
	analysis that is itself fully constrained by a range of biogeochemical
	tracers. The resulting model performs robustly even in the absence of
	such tracers. Given that several observational platforms measure
	temperature and salinity only, this approach enables the skilful
	classification of water masses within a much larger expanse of
	observational data. It also facilitates water mass analysis within
	large-scale state-estimate products and model output. We apply our RF
	model ensemble to the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the
	Ocean (ECCO) state estimate to produce a gridded Atlantic Ocean water
	mass product at monthly resolution, which we use to infer changes in
	Atlantic water mass structure over the last 30 years. Preliminary
	results indicate a contraction in Antarctic Bottom Water, an expansion
	of Central Water at the expense of Antarctic Intermediate Water in the
	Southern Ocean, and a possible poleward shift in Circumpolar Deep Water.},
